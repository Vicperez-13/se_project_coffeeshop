# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Adding color to the nav**link:hover and footer**social:hover might be more appealing to the eye than simply changing the the opacity.
- I also work for a coffee roaster, so I might make some youtube videos to show other processes of making espresso.
- Maybe tailor the project and make it a little more personal.
